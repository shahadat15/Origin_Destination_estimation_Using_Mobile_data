# Origin_Destination_estimation_Using_Mobile_data
Perl langulage has been used to remove the string ID from the raw data.

Database has been used to sort, filter and merge data. 

The OD estimation was done in two level:
  1. Tower to tower OD estimation
  2. Zone to zone (node to node) OD estimation

This OD estimation was coded in Matlab first. Later the same code has been converted in cpp to make the process faster.
